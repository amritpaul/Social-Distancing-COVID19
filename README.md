# Social-Distancing-COVID19

## Problem Statement
Identify if people are following social distancing with the help of a camera and object detection algorithm. If people are found to be breaking the rules, high pitch alarms and sounds can be made use to make them attentive. There can also be provisions to let the authorities know if there are any large scale social gatherings. Can you make this happen? Come up with a Proof of Concept.
