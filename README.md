# Social-Distancing-COVID19

## Problem Statement
Identify if people are following social distancing with the help of a camera and object detection algorithm. If people are found to be breaking the rules, high pitch alarms and sounds can be made use to make them attentive. There can also be provisions to let the authorities know if there are any large scale social gatherings. Can you make this happen? Come up with a Proof of Concept.

## Overview
- Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
- The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing 2019â€“20 coronavirus pandemic.
